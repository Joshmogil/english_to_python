Side project building a plain english interpreter using LLMs.

To use:

1. Get an api key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create a file called .env, add the api key: OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-G3 ...
3. Run python3 ./engterpreter.py

The agent will build out an application model, which will get converted to python 

This project is strictly for demonstration purposes, and will not be updated in any meaningful ways in the future.
