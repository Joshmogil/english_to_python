How this application should work: This personal finance app will need to manage and track financial transactions, including income, expenses, and savings. It should also provide the user with the ability to set budgets, categorize transactions, and generate reports. The app should have user authentication to ensure data privacy and security. Additionally, it should be able to send notifications for upcoming bills and financial goals. The user should be able to view their financial data in a clear and organized manner, with the option to customize the display based on their preferences.
