BEGIN - APPLICATION MODEL

How this application should work: This application is a simple calculator app that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It should have a user interface to input two numbers and select the operation to be performed. The app should then display the result of the operation. The data structures for this program include a 'Calculator' structure to hold the input numbers and the result. The functions for this program include 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', and 'divide' to perform the arithmetic operations. The relationships between the 'Calculator' structure and the arithmetic functions involve passing the input numbers from the 'Calculator' to the respective arithmetic function and receiving the result back from the function to display to the user.

Data Structures for this program: 
A Structure: {"name": "calculator", "attributes": "number1: float, number2: float, result: float", "description": "A structure to hold the input numbers and the result of the arithmetic operations."}

Functions for this program: 
A Function: {"name": "add", "arguments": "num1: float, num2: float", "returns": "float", "description": "Performs addition of two numbers."}
A Function: {"name": "subtract", "arguments": "num1: float, num2: float", "returns": "float", "description": "Performs subtraction of two numbers."}
A Function: {"name": "multiply", "arguments": "num1: float, num2: float", "returns": "float", "description": "Performs multiplication of two numbers."}
A Function: {"name": "divide", "arguments": "num1: float, num2: float", "returns": "float", "description": "Performs division of two numbers."}

Relationships between data structures and functions for this program: 
A Relationship: {"name": "input_to_add", "rationale": "Passes input numbers from the Calculator to the add function", "actor": "calculator", "reciever": "add", "relation": "passes"}
A Relationship: {"name": "input_to_subtract", "rationale": "Passes input numbers from the Calculator to the subtract function", "actor": "calculator", "reciever": "subtract", "relation": "passes"}
A Relationship: {"name": "input_to_multiply", "rationale": "Passes input numbers from the Calculator to the multiply function", "actor": "calculator", "reciever": "multiply", "relation": "passes"}
A Relationship: {"name": "input_to_divide", "rationale": "Passes input numbers from the Calculator to the divide function", "actor": "calculator", "reciever": "divide", "relation": "passes"}
